# Introduction

---

A country’s financial and monetary regime consists of

- The financial system
    - Financial institutions and markets
- Government financial regulation and supervision
- Central bank and central bank policy

## The real and financial sector of the economy

The real sector care about the domestic output of goods and services, resources that are used to produce them and their price in the market

The financial sector focuses on financial assets and liabilities, lending and borrowing, credit, money and interest rates.

Note that the real sector is no more real than the financial sector. They have influences on each other

## Measuring economic performance

### Actual and potential GDP

Real GDP is the final output of goods and services produced in the country over a period of time, holding price constant.

> [!important] Real GDP = C + I + G + (X - M), while
> 
> C: Consumer spending
> 
> I: Investment spending
> 
> G: Government spending
> 
> X: Exports of goods and services
> 
> M: Imports of goods and services

Meanwhile, nominal GDP, or market GDP, is real GDP at the current market price, or

> [!important] Nominal GDP = Real GDP * Price Index

And, the potential GDP is the level of output the country produces at “full employment” (this does not mean zero employment, there is still a number of natural unemployment)

Then, with the potential GDP, we have the GDP Gap

> [!important] GDP Gap = (Real GDP - Potential GDP) / Potential GDP

### Actual and natural unemployment rate

> [!important] UR = ((LF - E) / LF) * 100 = (NE / LF) * 100, while
> 
> UR: unemployment rate
> 
> LF: labor force
> 
> E: those who employed
> 
> NE: those who not employed
> 
> ⇒ LF = E + NE

Natural unemployment rate is the UR when GDP gap is 0.
