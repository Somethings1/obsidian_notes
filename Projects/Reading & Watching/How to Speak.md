> Your success in life will be determined largely by your ability to speak, your ability to write, and the quality of your ideas. In that order.

# How to start?

---

- Start by an empowerment promise
    - Tell people what they will know by the end of the talk, something that they didn’t know at the beginning.
    - Tell people how important that is in their lives

# Samples

---

- Cycle around the main point (repeat and expand it at least 3 times to ensure listeners are not fogged down)
- Encapsulate the idea, build a fence so that people won’t misunderstand yours with others’
- Use verbal punctuation
    - Employ pauses, changes in tone, and emphasis to structure your speech
    - This helps listeners follow your points more easily, similar to how punctuation aids in reading written text
    - Examples include:
        - Pausing briefly between main points
        - Raising your voice slightly to emphasize key words
        - Slowing down when introducing a new concept
- Ask a question, not so hard so that somebody could answer it

# Time & place

---

- Should be at the time when people are not sleepy, hungry or anything else
- The room should be well lit
- The room should be cased:
    - Check the acoustics to ensure your voice carries well
    - Ensure there are no distracting elements or potential interruptions
    - Familiarize yourself with the layout and any available equipment
- It should be well populated

# The board

---

- It has graphic effect: draw anything to express the idea
- Speed: the speed of writing on a board is the speed that people and absorb the idea
- It gives presenter’s hands a target to point or to write, no need to hide them in the pocket or behind the back

# Props

---

- Props are crucial elements in enhancing the effectiveness of a talk:
    - They provide visual aids that can help illustrate complex concepts
    - Props can make your presentation more memorable and engaging
    - They can serve as focal points, helping to maintain audience attention
    - Props can be used to demonstrate processes or ideas in a tangible way
    - They can add an element of surprise or humor, making your talk more dynamic
- When using props:
    - Ensure they are relevant to your topic and support your main points
    - Practice with them beforehand to avoid awkward moments during the presentation
    - Make sure they are visible and understandable to your entire audience
    - Don't let props overshadow your message; they should complement, not dominate

Remember, while props can greatly enhance a talk, they should be used judiciously and always in service of your core message.

# Inspiration

---

- Give the audience the feeling that they’re capable of anything they want
- Give the audience the new aspects of the problems
- Show the audience your passion in this idea

# Persuading

- Vision:
    - What you care about
